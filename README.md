# SolarFarm-Weather-Impact-SA
Data analysis of how weather variability impacts solar farm performance in South Africa, using long-term irradiance baselines and hourly weather data for actionable insights.

## Step 1: Understanding the Weather Context

### üß† Objective

To examine how temperature and solar irradiance affect solar farm output. This step establishes a foundational understanding of weather patterns so that downstream performance analysis reflects the true driving factors ‚Äî not just surface-level trends.

### üéØWhy This Step Matters

Understanding weather patterns is important because it allows us to examine the relationship between weather variability and solar farm performance. It also helps determine whether dips in performance are due to natural conditions or hardware issues. Without this context, analysis risks drawing misaligned conclusions. The goal here is to build a weather-performance baseline that supports clearer detection of underperformance.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Step 2: Weather Data Context

### üß† Purpose
Understanding weather patterns is important because it allows us to examine the possible relationship between weather variability and solar farm performance. This helps us determine whether fluctuations in output are due to natural weather conditions (like cloud cover or solar irradiance) or hardware issues on-site.

By building a weather baseline, we ensure the analysis is grounded in the environmental conditions that drive performance. This prevents misattributing underperformance and enables more accurate insights aligned with the true causes of output variability.

### üìä Data Sources & Their Role

| Dataset | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Solargis (GHI LTAy Daily Totals GeoTIFF)** | Provides **long-term solar irradiance averages** (LTAy) to serve as a **baseline** for expected solar performance at a geographic location. Helps detect persistent underperformance compared to historical norms. |
| **Global Solar Atlas (South Africa ‚Äì GHI daily totals GeoTIFF LTAy)** | Offers a **validated, World Bank-backed source** of long-term solar irradiance data. Acts as a **cross-reference** to Solargis data to ensure accuracy and consistency in baseline solar resource assessments. |
| **Open-Meteo Hourly Forecasts** | Supplies **short-term hourly weather data** (e.g. temperature, irradiance, cloud cover). Enables **granular daily analysis** of weather‚Äôs effect on solar output. Useful for identifying **daily fluctuations and anomalies**. |

## üìä Step 3: Data Cleaning & Preparation

### Overview

With our weather and solar irradiance datasets acquired, the next step is to prepare the data for analysis. This involves cleaning, formatting, and aligning the datasets so they can be compared over time and across variables.

### Tasks Completed

#### 1. Validated Open-Meteo Hourly Weather Data
- Verified that all key columns (`time`, `temperature_2m`, `relative_humidity_2m`, `wind_speed_10m`) contain usable hourly values.
- Confirmed the dataset spans 8,778 rows, ensuring full annual coverage.

#### 2. Assessed File Structure & Metadata
- Identified that timezone information is consistent but only provided for a single row.
- UTC offset and timezone abbreviation will be used later to ensure time alignment across sources if needed.

#### 3. Confirmed Integrity of Solargis GHI LTAy Daily Totals (GeoTIFF)
- This dataset remains untouched for now; we‚Äôll convert and match it to our weather dataset's format in the next step.
- Solargis serves as our long-term solar irradiance benchmark.

#### 4. Global Solar Atlas GHI Daily Totals (GeoTIFF)
- Downloaded and validated. Will be used in comparison to Solargis and Open-Meteo to test model robustness and regional irradiance variation.

### Why This Step Matters

Without consistent formatting and structure, we can‚Äôt perform accurate time-series analysis. Cleaning ensures we‚Äôre not modeling based on missing, misaligned, or misinterpreted data. The hourly weather data gives us granularity; the long-term GHI GeoTIFFs provide historical grounding.

## üó∫Ô∏è Step 1.5: Attempt to Extract SolarGIS GeoTIFF Data

As part of this project, I aimed to incorporate long-term average solar irradiance data from SolarGIS (in GeoTIFF format). This data was expected to provide a spatial view of solar potential across South Africa.

### üîç What I Tried:
- Uploaded the `.tif` file to [geotiff.io](https://geotiff.io), but the visual rendering was limited ‚Äî the raster displayed only in grayscale and lacked the expected color gradient or metadata overlay.
- Attempted to find alternative open-source, **web-based tools** to parse and extract the raster values (e.g. Mapshaper, GeoTIFF viewer plugins, etc.) but found that most tools require desktop GIS software (like QGIS), which I wanted to avoid for this step.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation:
Since this portfolio project is designed to be executed without installing external software, I made the decision to **pause this part** and proceed with the rest of the analysis using the **Open-Meteo hourly weather dataset** ‚Äî which is sufficient for answering the main research question.

### ‚úÖ Moving Forward:
The project will still maintain its integrity and value without this spatial layer, as the core focus remains on analyzing **temporal performance variability** in solar and wind energy systems using **real-time weather inputs**.
